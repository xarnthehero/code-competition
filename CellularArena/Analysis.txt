Cellular Organism

Behaviors per organism:

Sporer
	Create new root
		If organism has a sporer, see if it makes sense to create a new root
		For each sporer, look at possible root locations
			Prioritize high protein proximity and away from my other organisms
	Create a new sporer
		Direction hints
			Point toward the center of the map
			Point away from my other organisms

Create harvestor
	If multiple, prioritize protein with lowest harvester count
Get at least 1 C and D



Need to track:
	harvester count on each protein type
	heatmap of areas to go to - number of proteins within 3 spaces that I haven't harvested





--Rank 112 analysis and improvement ideas--
Movement
	Random placement should now look at how can we move towards the next protein
	Need to know when to bust through a protein to open up a big area
	With a group of proteins that I can only harvest 1 of, analyze best one to harvest
Sporer placement is terrible
	Prioritize early in the game
	Check that we can afford a new root - 4+ of each resource?
	Consult heat map
		Can we optimize this to prevent rechecking?
Attacking
	When enemy has tentacle with empty space between, they will likely place another tentacle down - see if I can kill that one preemptively
	If we are 2 spaces away from an enemy, we can look at putting down a tentacle
Harvesting
	We place harvesters on existing harvesting proteins
	If we are out of A or B but can build a harvester, prioritize harvesting an A/B if possible instead of eating it
	Multiple harvesters can be put down on the same turn for the same protein
Pathfinding
[Done]	Map from every point to every other point - distance and best direction?
	Need to reprocess portions when new walls are placed
Reconciliation
	List of outgoing and incoming organisms?
		This way I can readjust the map based on new walls, analyze what the enemy built last turn
Space Denial - late game this is what I'll need for closed maps
	Maybe worth focusing on, if I get this right it will result in a win every time
	Analyze if there is 1 space to control to cut off most of the map, plan centers around getting that space
Tracking
	Harvesters harvesting protein





Pathfinding Algorithm
	Shortest path from every tile to every other tile - distance, next direction to go
	Need to update when new walls are created
	Calculate at the beginning of the game
