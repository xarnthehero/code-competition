Cellular Organism

Behaviors per organism:

Sporer
	Create new root
		If organism has a sporer, see if it makes sense to create a new root
		For each sporer, look at possible root locations
			Prioritize high protein proximity and away from my other organisms
	Create a new sporer
		Direction hints
			Point toward the center of the map
			Point away from my other organisms

Create harvestor
	If multiple, prioritize protein with lowest harvester count
Get at least 1 C and D



Need to track:
	harvester count on each protein type
	heatmap of areas to go to - number of proteins within 3 spaces that I haven't harvested





--12/22/24 Rank 112 analysis and improvement ideas--
Movement
	Random placement should now look at how can we move towards the next protein
	Need to know when to bust through a protein to open up a big area - I can get boxed in easily
[Done]	With a group of proteins that I can only harvest 1 of, analyze best one to harvest - going based on lowest harvester count
[Done] When I need to build an arbitrary entity, prioritize types that I have a very large number of proteins for
Sporer placement is terrible
	Prioritize early in the game - after updates, not sure if this is needed, spore locations are working well
[Done]	Check that we can afford a new root - 4+ of each resource?
[Done]	Consult heat map
		    Can we optimize this to prevent rechecking?
[Done]  Use existing sporer instead of creating new one if possible
Attacking
	When enemy has tentacle with empty space between, they will likely place another tentacle down - see if I can kill that one preemptively
	If we are 2 spaces away from an enemy, we can look at putting down a tentacle
Harvesting
[Done]	We place harvesters on existing harvesting proteins
[Done]	If we are out of A or B but can build a harvester, prioritize harvesting an A/B if possible instead of eating it (done by swapping order of behaviors)
[Done]	Multiple harvesters can be put down on the same turn for the same protein
Pathfinding
[Done]	Map from every point to every other point - distance and best direction?
[Done]	Need to reprocess portions when new walls are placed
            In the short term, can reprocess only a limited range of cells (within 5) of a new wall, longer distance pathing shouldn't matter if incorrect
Reconciliation
[Done]	List of outgoing and incoming organisms?
    		This way I can readjust the map based on new walls, analyze what the enemy built last turn
Space Denial - late game this is what I'll need for closed maps
	Maybe worth focusing on, if I get this right it will result in a win every time
	Analyze if there is 1 space to control to cut off most of the map, plan centers around getting that space
Tracking
[Done]	Harvesters harvesting protein





Pathfinding Algorithm
	Shortest path from every tile to every other tile - distance, next direction to go
	Need to update when new walls are created
	Calculate at the beginning of the game
